### [Proposed] PatientInfo feature
#### Proposed Implementation



## Product scope
### Target user profile

Nurses working in hospitals who have shifts, schedules to manage.

### Value proposition

We want to organise shifts for Nurses, so that they can quickly retrieve information compared to digging out 
information from many different sources. To do this, users can add appointment dates/time to the schedule and handle
patient appointments to ensure that no patients are left out.
